  "summary": "This code implements a Flatfile Listener plugin for fetching Strava GPX data. It includes authentication with the Strava API, fetching GPX data, parsing it, and converting it to a tabular format suitable for Flatfile. The plugin also includes caching to avoid redundant API calls and utility functions for data processing.",
