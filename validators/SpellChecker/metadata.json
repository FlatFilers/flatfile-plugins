  "summary": "This code implements a spell-checking plugin for Flatfile using the nspell library. It includes configuration options for fields to check, custom dictionaries, language support, sheet slug, and automatic correction. The plugin processes records, identifies misspellings, provides suggestions, and can automatically correct text if configured to do so.",
