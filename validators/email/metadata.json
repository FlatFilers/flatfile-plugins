  "summary": "This is a Flatfile Listener plugin for email validation. It uses recordHook to validate email fields in a Flatfile sheet. The plugin checks for valid email format using regex, verifies the domain against a list of disposable email domains, and optionally performs a DNS lookup for domain validation. It includes configuration options for sheet slug, email fields, and automatic validation.",
