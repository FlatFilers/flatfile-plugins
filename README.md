# flatfile-plugins

Library of open-source plugins for developing with the Flatfile Platform

To get started building plugins:

1. Run `pnpm i` at the root level.
2. To make a changeset, run `pnpm run changeset` at the root level and choose the plugin you want to update.

Additional Commands

There are more commands that you can run on every plugin at the root level. For instance, the release is run by Github so you don't have to do this manually.


Each plugin has its own package.json that you can run.

1. `build` command uses what's in index.ts and builds a minified compiled version of the code using tsup. That is what gets published to npm.
