Introducing the GraphQL to Flatfile Blueprint plugin. This plugin can be used either to generate Flatfile Blueprint from GraphQL or to configure a Flatfile Space from GraphQL. Several options are available to provide the GraphQL to the plugin. It either can be provided from a GraphQL API endpoint, a GraphQL schema file, or a custom callback function.
