# @private/sandbox

This is a development sandbox for plugins. To get started, go to the repo root and run:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
```

Navigate to the plugin you're working on and run:

```bash
npm run build:watch
```

Then navigate to the sandbox folder and copy `.env.example` to `.env` and update it with your environment variables.

Finally, run the sandbox with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

As you make changes to the plugin, the sandbox will update automatically.
